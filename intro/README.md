# Overview

One of the most common questions that I get during a [training](https://voidstarsec.com/training) is - "What do we need to build up an initial hardware hacking lab." Of course, the answer to this question can be heavily tailored based on the goals of the team and their targets, but I wanted to attempt documenting what would make for a good starter lab. 

The following document aims to outline the minimum requirements for an embedded systems laboratory; as a bare minimum, one should have the following in their lab:

1. Multimeter
2. Soldering Equipment
3. Breadboard/Jumper Wires
4. Logic Analyzer
5. Oscilloscope
6. Magnifying glass

In this list, I will focus on devices that I and a few others regularly use for hardware pen testing and research. I will list a range of devices covering various budgets. 

It should be noted that the following recommendations are my opinion, and **none** of the links below are affiliate links or anything of the sort. This guide is to help people build out their first lab, not make money. This guide will also be maintained at the GitHub repository located [here](https://github.com/voidstarsec/hw-hacking-lab) - please submit your pull requests with your suggestions and favorite tools!
